Wordle in Excel for Practicing
Go to cell B1 and enter F2, then F9 to lock the current word (PC instructions), or type in any number between 1 and whatever number appears when you open file.

Type in your guesses in cells B3 to B8.

This wordle game will only play old words starting about 10 days ago.  
Also, this game includes all the words that have been removed (I think) so the dates don't match up.  
This game does not keep statistic and is just for practicing.  
It does have a duplicate warning message in cell E1.  
Delete if you don't want it. 
Use undo to reset or don't save when exiting out.  

The conditional formatting was tedious, so the cell colors in the letter-bank are simply grey.
